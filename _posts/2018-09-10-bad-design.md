Bad design is found throughout Williams. An example of bad design that students encounter at Williams can be found in the Horn Hall dorms. The images below show how inconvenient and unintuitive it is to open a window in Horn:

If I wanted to open the window of the dorm, I have to go through a series of unintuitive steps. First, I would have to raise the blinds all the way to the top of the window as can be seen in the photos. Then I would have to open the screen by pulling on the handle such that it would open like a door. Then, I would have to open the window by pushing on the window itself.

This is a poor example of window design at Williams because 1) most people are too short to close the blinds/raise the blinds to the top of the window 2) the ability to open the screen door is hindered by the metal bar, making only a narrow opening for a hand to open the window itself 3) the unintuitive design is a hazard in case of emergency. See more image below.
