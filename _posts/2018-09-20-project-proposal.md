# Problem:

A problem that WCMA faces is their ability to showcase many different collections and collaborations at the same time. WCMA encourages student and faculty collaborations and for that reason there are many opportunities for new exhibits in the museum. Since there is limited physical space at WCMA, this negatively effects the ability for curators and collaborators to engage with the collections or showcase new exhibits. Currently, their solution is a quick turnover of exhibits and features.

# Solution:

Inspiration for this project comes the virtual reality room found in Sawyer Library. After our visit and group discussion at WCMA, I felt that it is extremely important to expand upon the museum's ability to showcase many different collaborations and exhibits. Using virtual reality technology, an extension of the museum can be created and showcase many more new AND old exhibits. Visitors will be able to 'walk' through the extension of the museum and visit pieces as if they are seeing them in person. Curators will be able to organize pieces as if they are being arranged in a real museum. The virtual reality technology will render the art as if the visitor is seeing them in person. The virtual reality technology will not replace any of the museum's features, it will just add a new space for visitors to engage with art. Curators will be able to organize pieces as if they are being arranged in a real museum. The virtual reality technology will render the art as if the visitor is seeing them in person. 

A virtual reality version of the museum allows users to interact with the museum as if they are walking through a real museum. They can visit old exhibits, new exhibits or even view random pieces. The virtual reality museum will utilize WCMA's extensive online art and data collections and allow users to experience art in an intimate environment (See Figure 1). This virtual museum allows curators to showcase more exhibits and collaborations and allow the visitors to interact with the pieces at anytime.

The idea for this project falls under the following MuseTech sub-topics: Escaping the Museum, Museum Connections, Museum of the Future, Visitor Experiences.
