A problem that WCMA faces is their ability to showcase many different collections and collaborations at the same time. WCMA encourages student and faculty collaborations and for that reason there are many opportunities for new exhibits in the museum. Since there is limited physical space at WCMA, this negatively effects the ability for curators and collaborators to engage with the collections or showcase new exhibits.

Inspiration for this project comes the virtual reality room found in Sawyer Library. After our visit and group discussion at WCMA

The idea for this project falls under the following MuseTech sub-topics: Escaping the Museam, Museam Connections, Museam of the Future, Visitor Experiences.
