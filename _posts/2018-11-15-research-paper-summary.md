# Research Paper Report 

For this assignment I read a study conducted by Kotturi et al., “Structure and Messaging Techniques for Online Peer Learning Systems that Increase Stickiness.” This paper analyzes how software can be used to enable and improve peer learning systems when in person, guided interactions are not available. Online participation is limited by lack of user information and demographics. This creates design challenges in creating a system to encourage peer learning. This paper shows how two online platforms, Talkabout and PeerStudio engages students in discussions with peers from diverse regions and different cultural backgrounds. The paper discussed how teachers and professors can use these platforms to maximize learning and increase a sense of community. Most importantly, the paper emphasized the importance of encouraging and drawing participation. Many instructors and software developers assumed that people would participate and interact with the software like successful social networking services like Facebook. However, this is not the case, different goals and incentives should be considered when developing this software and advertising it to other people. In addition, results from this paper show that humanized software and prompts influences users’ contribution and feedback on the platform. Unstructured discussion and topics do not increase sense of community or being. Discussions designed in this fashion that were happening on these platforms were shown to increase peer empathy through fostered pro-social norms and mutually beneficial behavior. Although I do wish this paper did not just apply to the classroom settings, after skimming similar, shorter studies conducted by the same researchers the topic of peer learning through online software is an ongoing revolutionary subject area that will allow for sharing of more ideas, peer learning and collaboration. I believe the main points of the paper –I think there are many areas, not just the classroom, where online peer learning systems can help. 

Although this paper focuses on online peer learning systems in an educational/classroom application, it is still extremely relevant to our project. Our project aims to make museums more accessible for all visitors. By creating a platform where users can learn and contribute their opinions regarding certain discussion topic, we need similar software to enable peer learning and increase participation. I believe we designed a product that effectively will increase participation and sense of community in a manner that coincides with the conclusions of this paper. We provide structured discussion topics and contextual information regarding every exhibit and humanized responses via text and help pop-ups/FAQs. As a result, hopefully users will feel more comfortable sharing their opinions. I believe we designed a product that would improve an area of peer learning that was lacking in the museum setting. Although if this paper was read earlier, we would have put more emphasis on learning about how important peer learning is to creating a sense of community in specifically the museum setting.
